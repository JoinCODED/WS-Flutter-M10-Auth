Authentication is the process of recognizing a userâ€™s identity. It is the mechanism of associating an incoming request with a set of identifying credentials. The credentials provided are compared to those on the backend and if they are correct, the server will assign certain permissions and rules for the requests coming from that user.

A common example is when a user logs in into your app with a username and a password, and if they are correct, you will give some permissions to this user. In our example, we are going to change the backend url to this one:

```
to add later
```

And the difference here is that this backend will not allow unregistered users to add a new book.

If you need a starting point, fork and clone (this)[] into your development folder.
